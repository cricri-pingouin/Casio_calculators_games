Mcl:E3Ran#→A:Lbl 0:Isz C:?→B:B<A⇒"+"◢B>A⇒"-"◢B≠A⇒Goto 0:C

Or if you don't want to use Mcl which clears all variables, initialise C (costs 2 extra steps):

0→C:E3Ran#→A:Lbl 0:Isz C:?→B:B<A⇒"+"◢B>A⇒"-"◢B≠A⇒Goto 0:C

List of variables:
  A: secret number to guess
  B: player guess
  C: number of guesses

Notee:
- ◢ = "stop and display" command
- E3 is equivalent to 1000x but saves 3 steps
