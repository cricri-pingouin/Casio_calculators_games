# Casio_calculators_games
Couple of games for Casio graphic calculators that I wrote in the early 1990s. Written on a Casio fx-7000g, which was very short on programming steps, so those are heavily optimised for size.

- guessnumber (42 steps): guess the number between 0 and 1000 in as few guesses as possible; lowest score is best.
- squash (164 steps): bounce the ball off the wall as many times as you can; highest score is best.
