# Casio_calculators_games
Couple of games for Casio graphic calculators that I wrote in 1990 on a Casio fx-7000g, which was very short on programming steps (422 to be precise), so those are heavily optimised for size.

- guessnumber (42 steps): guess the integer between 0 and 1000 in as few guesses as possible. Number of attempts is displayed upon guessing the correct number.
- squash (161 steps): move the racket by entering its Y co-ordinate (rational number between 0 and 1) when the ball hits the wall, and hope that it bounces off the racket when it comes back. The goal is to achieve the highest score, with each bounce worth 1 point. Score is displayed upon missing the ball.

I also wrote a blackjack but I lost the code.
